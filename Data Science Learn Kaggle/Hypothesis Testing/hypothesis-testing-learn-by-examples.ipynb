    "Does our dice roll a 3 or less 50% of the time and a 4+ 50% of the time?\n",

    "Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "We roll a dice 10 times noting the results. We write 1 if the roll is greater or equal to 4 and 0 otherwise.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    roll 3       4              1\n",
    "\n",
    "    roll 4       5              1\n",
    "\n",
    "    roll 5       1              0\n",
    "\n",
    "    roll 6       3              0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    roll 7       3              0\n",

    "\n",
    "    roll 10      6              1\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Set a null hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "First we assume that it does roll a 4+ 50% of the time, this is our **null hypothesis** usually notated as $H_0$. Therefore our **alternative** hypothesis must be that the dice does not roll a 4+ 50% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Set a critical value\n",
    "\n",
    "We set a critical value of $\\alpha = 0.05$. This is equivalent to saying, we will only reject the null hypothesis if our results are so extreme that the probability of obtaining them (or more extreme results) is less than 5% whilst assuming the null hypothesis to be true. Note that the critical value is totally arbitrary depending on what goal you re trying to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Find the p-value\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value is the probability of seeing results at least as extreme as the results we've obtained whilst assuming the null hypothesis to be true. We rolled a 4+ 3 times, so we need to find the probability of rolling a 4+ 3 or less times. This means finding the probability of rolling a 4+  0,1,2 and 3 times and adding them up.\n",
    "\n",
    "0) The probability of roll a 4+ 0 times is $0.5^{10}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The probability of roll a 4+ 1 time is ${10 \\choose 1} \\cdot 0.5^{10}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) The probability of roll a 4+ 2 times is ${10 \\choose 2} \\cdot 0.5^{10}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The probability of roll a 4+ 3 times is ${10 \\choose 3} \\cdot 0.5^{10}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding all of these up we get $\\sum {10 \\choose i} 0.5^{10} = 0.5^{10} \\sum {10 \\choose i} = \\dfrac{11}{64} = 0.171875$\n",
    "\n",
    "<i> We found the p-value explicitly here using the binomial distribution. Our test statistic was 3 i.e the number to input into our probability distribution function. In most cases the type of test is dependant on the type of distribution that's needed to calculate p from the test statistic.</i> \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "If this were a fair dice, it would get a result at least as extreme as ours 17% of the time which is above the critical value and so we accept the null hypothesis.\n",
